## Features in Detail

### Favoriting System
Users can favorite Pokémon by clicking the heart icon. Favorited Pokémon are stored locally and can be viewed in the Favorites tab. The favoriting action includes a delightful animation with floating hearts.

### Skeleton Loading
While data is being fetched, the app displays skeleton loading placeholders that match the shape and size of the actual content, reducing perceived loading time.
